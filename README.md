About Me:
My name is Andre Hollingsworth and I currently attend Bard High School in Newark. I am a follower of christ and do enjoy reading my bible. I also do enjoy day trading stocks and options. In the future, I aspire to become an oncology pharmacist—a healthcare professional who specializes in the use of medications to treat cancer. This career aligns with both my passion for science and my desire to help people during one of the most difficult times in their lives. As an oncology pharmacist, I will play a crucial role in ensuring that cancer patients receive the safest and most effective treatments available. To reach this goal, I will first earn my Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree, pass all necessary licensing exams, and then pursue advanced training through residency programs, including a PGY-2 specialization in oncology pharmacy. My ultimate goal is to become board-certified in oncology pharmacy (BCOP), which will allow me to work at top hospitals, cancer centers, or research institutions.
